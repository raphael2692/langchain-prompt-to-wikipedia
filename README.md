# langchain-prompt-to-wikipedia

This is an example of how to use Langchain framework to use online wikipedia data to answer to a user prompt. 

The same technique could be used with different site. 

The script is a WIP, for example it does not handle the case where the wikipedia page does not exist. It is howevere very cool IMHO.
